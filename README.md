I'm a guy who loves working with challenging and creative projects. I love to develop solutions through technology and positively impact people, I am in constant search for best practices and also trying new things.

I am a JavaScript enthusiast and my specialty is front-end development using React / React Native. I also have aptitude for back end development with Node.js, in addition to solid knowledge in UX, interface design and systems usability.

I am currently studying some interesting frameworks and skills in order to evolve as a professional, some of them are: Next.js, Expo, Context API, Node.js, Express.js and I have been looking to advance in the English language.

:rocket: Let's code!
