### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer who loves working with challenging and creative projects. I am constantly looking for best practices and also trying new things. I love developing solutions through technology, and for me, learning is a lifelong process.

I have experience with web and mobile application programming. Currently my focus is on developing digital solutions using React and React Native at @somapay.
